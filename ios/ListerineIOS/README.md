# Listerine iPhone app

This folder contains a starter SwiftUI iPhone client for Listerine.

## Included app flow

- first-launch backend URL entry and local persistence
- passkey sign-up button
- passkey login button
- placeholder passkey request generation using `AuthenticationServices`
- integration notes for connecting to the future backend passkey endpoints

## Project setup in Xcode

1. Open Xcode 16 or newer on macOS.
2. Create a new **App** project named `Listerine` using **SwiftUI** and **Swift**.
3. Replace the generated Swift files with the source files from this folder.
4. Add the `AuthenticationServices` framework if Xcode does not link it automatically.
5. Set the deployment target to **iOS 16.0** or newer.
6. Run the app on an iPhone simulator or device.

## Backend work needed to finish passkey auth

The app is intentionally ready only up to local passkey request creation. To complete the feature, the backend will need endpoints that:

1. return a WebAuthn registration challenge for sign-up
2. verify the registration response and create the account
3. return a WebAuthn assertion challenge for login
4. verify the assertion response and establish an authenticated session or token
5. expose the relying party ID and any environment-specific passkey metadata the app should trust

When those routes exist, update `PasskeyAuthService.swift` to fetch the challenge from the configured backend URL and POST the completed registration/assertion payload back to the API.

## Shipping to the App Store

1. Join the Apple Developer Program and create an App ID for the iOS app.
2. In Xcode, configure the bundle identifier, signing team, app icon, launch assets, and display metadata.
3. Add privacy disclosures in App Store Connect, including whether account identifiers or diagnostics are collected.
4. If passkeys are used in production, verify the associated domains and WebAuthn relying party configuration you will use for the final backend.
5. Test on physical devices, especially sign-in flows, keyboard behavior, and network error handling.
6. Archive the app in Xcode, validate it, and upload it through Organizer.
7. In App Store Connect, create the app record, complete screenshots, pricing, age rating, and submission notes.
8. Submit for App Review and be ready to provide a demo account or backend test environment if Apple asks for one.
